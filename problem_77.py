Oh no! The planets are jumbled up again!

ABOUT
Did you know that there is a mnemonic to remember the planets in there order in our Solar System.

The mnemonic is the sentence "My Very Efficient Mother Just Served Us Nuts", where the M of "My" stands for Mercury, V of "Very" for Venus, E of "Efficient" for Earth and so on.

TASK
Now that the planets are all jumbled up, some people have decided to come up with a new mnemonic, and your task is to confirm whether the mnemonic they have made fits the new Solar System using a program.

So, given the Solar System in the form of a list, you have to return a boolean value that is either True if the mnemonic is correct or False if it is not.

However, an Asteroid has to be ignored as it should not be part of the mnemonic.

Pluto will never be part of the Solar System.

EXAMPLES
["Earth", "Jupiter", "Asteroid", "Asteroid", "Mercury", "Asteroid", "Saturn"], "Even Jaguars Make Spaghetti" -> True
# E of "Even" stands for Earth
# J of "Jaguars" stands for Jupiter
# Asteroid is ignored
# Another Asteroid is ignored
# M of "Make" stands for Mercury
# Asteroid is ignored again
# Finally, S of "Spaghetti" stands for Saturn
# As the whole mnemonic fits the given Solar System, you have to just return True

["Asteroid", "Mars", "Uranus", "Asteroid"], "Water Melon" -> False
NOTES
All the planet names will be Title Case and so will be the mnemonic
There will never be more than one of anything except Asteroids
If the Solar System is empty or it contains only Asteroids, then empty string mnemonic, "", is valid. However, "Hello" is not valid.
The Solar System will never contain anything outside ["Asteroid", "Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
Pluto will never be part of the Solar System
